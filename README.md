# Weather_In_City-Python
Having fun learning about implementing APIs.

This program uses the WeatherAPI to get the current weather information for a given city. The user enters the name of the city in the city_entry widget, and the program then makes an API call to the WeatherAPI to get the current temperature. The temperature is then displayed in the temperature_entry widget on the GUI
